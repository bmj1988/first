    <h1 class="erm">Help me write!</h1>
    <p class="erm"> Hi, I'm Brian. I created this website for two reasons: 1) I had to
        as a part of my schoolwork and 2) because I love to write, but my life
        is so busy I rarely get the chance! So I decided that by crowd-sourcing
        my ideas, I would write a lot more often, in a lot of different genres, and for a good reason. So I
        invite you, dear reader, to submit ideas that you would like me to write
        a brief (1 page) shortstory about.
    </p>
    <h2 class="erm">About my writing</h2>
    <p class="erm"> I write a number of genres on my own time, mostly horror, fantasy, and
        suspense. I love writing grounded fantasy, that is, fantasy settings with strange
        but mostly logical frameworks and characters that behave as human beings
        do - or at least behave in ways that logically and coherently proceed
        from their circumstances. My writing tends to be focused on philosopical
        topics, human psychology, interpersonal relationships, estrangement
        (personally and culturally), and cosmic horror (mankind grappling
        with its place in the vastness of the cosmos). </p>
    <p class="erm"> Don't allow your submissions to be limited to what I <em>normally</em>
        write! Asking you to submit ideas that it sounds like I would want to write
        sounds more like work for the user than work for me. Feel free to submit
        whatever it is your heart desires* and I will do my best to deliver a short
        passage you would want to read. This could be romance, sci-fi, even a poem
        or haiku. I will even read your fortune using tarot or the i-ching and
        submit a brief report.</p>
    <h2 class="erm">The process</h2>
    <p class="erm">First you use the navigation bar to your left to access the submission form,
        then fill in all the relevant fields. The form will generate a ticket, and I will
        begin working on those tickets as they generate and as my schedule permits. When
        the writing is done, I will send you an email notification with a link to the story
        that you have commissioned. All commissions are posted publicly on this
        website and placed in the Gallery section.
    </p>
    <p class="erm">I will try to deliver all writing within a week of submission, but remember
        that I am a student and run a company, and have all kinds of other
        obligations which may prohibit me from delivering your commissioned piece
        of writing exactly on time. I will avoid e-mailing you updates (because,
        hey, I'm already strapped for time and I'm doing this for free, and
        nobody really wants me e-mailing them updates!) but feel free to e-mail
        me any questions related to delivery. Keep in mind the commissioned pieces will be
        no more (but maybe less, depending on the context) than 1 page in length.
        This means if you ask me to write a sci-fi epic, I may write an abridged
        version, or I may just write a page out of a sci-fi epic that seems like
        a significant point.
    </p>
    <h2 class="erm">Curiousity, enjoyment, or a gift!</h2>
    <p class="erm">You can use this service for your own personal enjoyment, utility, or as a gift to
        someone to commemorate an occasion. I will write poems for you to insert
        in cards, or a story for you to tell your kids at bedtime, or even a
        motivational speech for you to look at before you go to the gym!
    </p>
    <p class="erm">*Just remember that this is a free service intended to generate public-facing
        work for my portfolio! That means everything will be posted publicly, and
        I will have some content restrictions. Sex, death, murder,
        and gore are rich and provocative literary elements, but commissions including
        elements of this kind will be in a separate section of the gallery,
        and any outright pornographic (including gore/ultraviolence) requests
        will be refused. If you wish to contact me regarding a private commission,
        use the button below.
